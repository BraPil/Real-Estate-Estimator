# V3.4 Completion Summary: Repository Professionalization

**Date:** December 9, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Decision:** Stop technical development to focus on presentation preparation.

## Overview
This phase focused on transforming the repository from a working development environment into a polished, professional artifact suitable for technical interviews and presentation.

## Key Actions
1.  **Repository Restructuring:**
    - Created `archive/` for obsolete scripts and logs.
    - Organized `docs/` into `manuals/` and `reports/`.
    - Renamed `Reference_Docs` to `references/`.
2.  **Documentation Overhaul:**
    - Rewrote `README.md` to tell the "Project Story" (MVP -> Enterprise).
    - Updated `master_log.md` to reflect the final structure.
3.  **Git Hygiene:**
    - Excluded large reference data files from the repository.
    - Merged all changes to `main`.

## Technical Decisions
- **Deferred Log Transformation:** Initial experiments showed minimal returns. Given the model's high accuracy (R² ~0.87) and the time constraints, we decided not to pursue this further.
- **Deferred Ensembles:** The XGBoost model is performing exceptionally well. Adding complexity with ensembles was deemed unnecessary for the current goals.

## Final State
The repository is now in a "Presentation Ready" state.
- **Active Code:** `src/` contains only the production-ready scripts (`train_with_mlflow.py`, `evaluate_fresh.py`, `tune_v33.py`).
- **History:** The evolution of the project is preserved in `archive/` and `docs/reports/`.
- **Stability:** All tests pass on the `main` branch.

## Next Steps
- Prepare for the final presentation.
- Whiteboard the architecture and data flow.
- Explain the code to stakeholders.
